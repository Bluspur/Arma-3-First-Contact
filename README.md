> A West German Patrol is ambushed near Mariental

## Setting
A 1-2 player scenario where you take on the role of West German border guards on a routine patrol of the Inner German Border. But it is far from a normal day as on your patrol, East German forces cross into West German territory and begin attacks on military positions. Lightly armed and severely outnumbered, your mission is to evade East German forces and to make it back to friendly lines.
## Features
This was my first scenario written using SQF and was written almost purely in SQF as a challenge to myself.
It features:
- Scripted events; i.e. aircraft flybys, radio communications (unvoiced), set piece attacks.
- Objectives; updated with the flow of the scenario's story
- Hunter squads; infantry groups that spawn in a number of random locations that will try to ambush the players.
- Helicopter transports; enemy groups that will arrive via helicopter to a number of locations based on player proximity and then will become hunter squads.
## Notes
As mentioned this was a scenario I created with the restriction of only using SQF. That means that there are a lot of places where I was setting waypoint locations and AI behaviour via code and not with the Eden editor, which would have been more reasonable. I learned a huge amount from this project and it might honestly have been the foundation of my path to becoming a programmer. I have learned a lot since then, especially in the realms of good SQF, and that is visible in more recent projects.
